    "text": "R is one of the leading programming languages in Data Science and Public Health Research. It is widely used to perform statistics, machine learning, visualizations, and data analyses. It is an open-source programming language, meaning all the software we will use in the course is free.\nThis course is designed as an introduction to R and RStudio for participants with no prior programming experience. We will start from scratch by introducing how to start programming in R, read and write data, manipulate data, and visualize data by creating different plots — covering all the fundamental tasks needed to begin analyzing your own data.\nWe will use RStudio, a powerful and user-friendly interface that makes developing R code much easier. During the course, we will also introduce you to the tidyverse, a collection of essential R packages including dplyr and ggplot2 that simplify data manipulation and visualization.",
