# Overview

**R** is one of the leading programming languages in **Data Science** and **Public Health Research**. It is widely used to perform statistics, machine learning, visualizations, and data analyses. It is an open-source programming language, meaning **all the software we will use in the course is free**.

This course is designed as an **introduction to R and RStudio for participants with no prior programming experience**. We will start from scratch by introducing how to start programming in R, read and write data, manipulate data, and visualize data by creating different plots — covering all the fundamental tasks needed to begin analyzing your own data.

We will be using **RStudio**, a powerful and user-friendly interface that simplifies writing and developing R code. In this session, we’ll cover data types in R, perform basic operations and data manipulation, and introduce **ggplot2** for data visualization.

# Target Audience

This course is designed for participants:

\- With little or no previous experience in R or programming.

\- Working or studying in public health, epidemiology, infectious disease research, or related fields.

\- Interested in gaining practical skills for data analysis and modeling.

# Sessions

The course will cover the following sessions:

1\. **Getting started**: Installing R and RStudio, understanding the RStudio environment.

2\. **Introduction to R Programming**: Basic operations, data types, writing scripts.

3\. **Starting with Data**: Reading, exploring, and saving datasets.

4\. **Visualization with ggplot2**: Using `ggplot2` for creating publication-quality figures.

# Data

We will work with example datasets commonly used in public health, including synthetic outbreak data and demographic information. All datasets will be accessed either from the `data/` folder in the GitHub repository (<https://github.com/VVVVivi/Intro-to-rstudio>) or downloaded directly within R during the sessions.

# Setup Instructions

All the software required to run this course should be installed on your machine. Please ensure that **R** and **RStudio** are installed on your computer before the workshop.

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations:

\- R is the core statistical computing environment.

\- RStudio is a user-friendly interface for R.

Instructions are available for: - [Windows](#windows) - [macOS](#macos) - [Linux](#linux). Please follow the appropriate section for your operating system.

## Windows {#windows}

### If you already have R and RStudio installed

-   Open RStudio, click `Help > Check for Updates`. Update if necessary.
-   To check your R version, start RStudio and type `sessionInfo()`.
-   You can also check the latest version on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

-   Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
-   Install the downloaded `.exe` file.
-   Download RStudio from the [RStudio download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
-   Choose **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows Vista/7/8/10**.
-   Install RStudio and open it to check it runs correctly.

## macOS {#macos}

### If you already have R and RStudio installed

-   Open RStudio, click `Help > Check for Updates`.
-   Start RStudio and type `sessionInfo()` to check your R version.
-   Verify your version against [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

-   Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
-   Install the `.pkg` file.
-   Install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) if prompted.
-   Download RStudio from the [RStudio download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
-   Choose **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**.
-   Install and test RStudio.

## Linux {#linux}

-   Follow Linux distribution instructions from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
-   For Ubuntu/Debian: Install R via `sudo apt-get install r-base`.
-   Download RStudio from the [RStudio download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
-   Install using: `sudo dpkg -i rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb`.
-   Open RStudio to verify it works.

Additionally, you will need to install the **ggplot2** package. Details are provided in the setup section.
