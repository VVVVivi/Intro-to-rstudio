# What is R?

![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png){width="60" height="47"}

**R** is a free software environment for statistical computing, data visualization, and data analysis. It is widely used in academic research, public health, and industry. It allows you to work with data and create plots, statistical models, and even simulations.

## Why learn R?

## R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking

The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that’s a good thing!

So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again.

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes.

Working with scripts also forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.

### R code is great for reproducibility

Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.

R integrates with other tools to generate reports from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically after running the code again.

An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.

### R is interdisciplinary and extensible

With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data.

For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more.

### R works on data of different sizes

The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you.

R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient.

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.

### R produces high-quality graphics

The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.

### R has a large and welcoming community

Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), or on the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com).

### Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform

Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.

# What is RStudio?

![](images/clipboard-2534404882.png){width="60"}

[RStudio](https://posit.co/) is currently a very popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R. An IDE is an application used by software developers that facilitates programming by offering source code editing, building and debugging tools all integrated into one application. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

The RStudio Desktop open-source product is free under the [Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html). [Other versions of RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) are also available.

We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.

RStudio is divided into 4 “Panes”:

1.  the **Source** for your scripts and documents (top-left),
2.  your **Environment/History** (top-right),
3.  your **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right),
4.  and the **Console** (bottom-left).

The layout can be customized from *Tools → Global Options → Pane Layout*.

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and less error-prone.

## **Create an R Project**

Before starting to write code in RStudio, we need to create an R Project. An R Project is a workspace where you can keep all files and settings associated with a project. It makes resuming work easier.

To create an “R Project”:

1.  Start RStudio.
2.  Under the `File` menu, click `New Project`. Choose `New Directory`, then `New Project`.
3.  Enter a name and choose a convenient location. This will be your **working directory**.
4.  Click on `Create Project`.
5.  (Optional) Set preferences to “Never” save workspace in RStudio.

RStudio’s default preferences generally work well, but saving a workspace to `.RData` can be cumbersome, especially if you are working with larger datasets as this would save all the data that is loaded into R into the `.RData` file.

To turn it off, go to: `Tools` → `Global Options` → General and select the 'Never' option for `Save workspace to .RData on exit`.
